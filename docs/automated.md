When you are running your script in an automated environment, you can control **wandb** with environment variables set before the script runs or within the script.

```shell
# This is secret and shouldn't be checked into version control
WANDB_API_KEY=$YOUR_API_KEY
# Description is optional
WANDB_DESCRIPTION="$SHORT_MESSAGE"
```

```shell
# Only needed if you don't checkin the wandb/settings file
WANDB_ENTITY=$username
WANDB_PROJECT=$project
```

```python
# If you don't want your script to sync to the cloud
os.environ['WANDB_MODE'] = 'dryrun'
```

Optional environment variables:

| Variable name          | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WANDB_API_KEY**      | Sets the authentication key associated with your account. You can find your key at <https://app.wandb.ai/profile>. This must be set if `wandb login` hasn't been run on the remote machine.                                                                                                                                              |
| **WANDB_DESCRIPTION**  | Description associated with a run. This will become the name of your run in the UI. If not set it will be randomly generated for you                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **WANDB_ENTITY**       | The entity associated with your run. If you have run `wandb init` in the directory of your training script, it will create a directory named _wandb_ and will save a default entity which can be checked into source control. If you don't want to create that file or want to override the file you can use the environmental variable. |
| **WANDB_USERNAME**     | The username of a member of your team associated with the run. This can be used along with a service account API key to enable attribution of automated runs to members of your team.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **WANDB_PROJECT**      | The project associated with your run. This can also be set with `wandb init`, but the environmental variable will override the value.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **WANDB_MODE**         | By default this is set to _run_ which saves results to wandb. If you just want to save your run metadata locally, you can set this to _dryrun_.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **WANDB_DIR**          | Set this to an absolute path to store all generated files here instead of the _wandb_ directory relative to your training script. _be sure this directory exists and the user your process runs as can write to it_                                                                                                                      |
| **WANDB_RETRY**        | By default this is set to _never_. If you store the id generated by wandb (accessed via `wandb.run.id`), you can use it to resume failed runs by setting this to _must_ and **WANDB_RUN_ID** as described below. If you want to always generate your own unique ids, set this to _allow_ and always set **WANDB_RUN_ID**.                |
| **WANDB_RUN_ID**       | Set this to a globally unique string (per project) corresponding to a single run of your script. It must be no longer than 64 characters. All non-word characters will be converted to dashes. This can be used to resume an existing run in cases of failure.                                                                           |
| **WANDB_IGNORE_GLOBS** | Set this to a comma seperated list of file globs to ignore. These files will not be synced to the cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **WANDB_ERROR_REPORTING** | Set this to false to prevent wandb from logging fatal errors to it's error tracking system. |

| **WANDB_SHOW_RUN** | Set this to true to automatically open a browser with the run url if your operating system supports it.
