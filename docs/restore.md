## Overview

Calling `wandb.restore(filename)` will restore a file into your run. It returns a local file object open for reading.

`wandb.restore` accepts a few keyword arguments:

- **run_path** &mdash; String telling the run to pull from in the format _'$ENTITY_NAME/$PROJECT_NAME/$RUN_NAME'_ or _'$PROJECT_NAME/$RUN_NAME'_ (_default: current entity, project and run_)

A common usecase is resuming from a checkpoint in the case of failure. 

Another common use is to restore the model file from a previous run.

## Example

```python
if args.restore:
    wandb.restore('model.h5') # restore from a checkpoint, resuming must be configured
weights = wandb.restore('best.h5', run_path="vanpelt/html/a1b2c3d")
model.load(weights.name)
```

> If you don't specify a run_path, you'll need to configure [resuming](resuming) for your run.
> If you want access to files programitcally outside of training, checkout the [Export API](integrations/api).
